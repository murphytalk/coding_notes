Collection of my notes on coding and solutions to various small problems, a reminder to myself.

The language used is C++ (C++ 14 features used), the dependencies are:

 1. [boost](http://www.boost.org/).
 1. [Catch](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch) unit test. See Catch's docs on [command line options and arguments](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch/blob/master/docs/command-line.md).

All examples/tests are tagged, run this to list all tags:

```
./note -t 
```
Run this to list all examples/tests:

```
./note -l
```
This will run all examples/tests whose name start with "Add" and are tagged with "leetcode". `-d y` is to show how much test is used for each test:

```
./notes 'Add*' '[leetcode]'  -d y
```
